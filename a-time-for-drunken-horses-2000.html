<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>A Time For Drunken Horses movie review (2000)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The children work every day in a nearby town. They are child labor, put to work wrapping glasses for export, or staggering under heavy loads they carry around the marketplace. Their hand-to-mouth existence undercuts easy Western theories about child labor; they work to eat, and will be dead if they don't.</p><p>We see them in the back of a truck returning to their village, and there is a shot that emotionally charges the whole film. Ayoub and Ameneh sit close together, both helping to hold little Madi. Ayoub caresses the hair of the little creature, and Ameneh gently kisses him.</p><p>They love their crippled brother, who never speaks throughout the film, who must have regular injections of medicine, who needs an operation, who will probably die within the year even if he gets the operation.</p><p>The truck is stopped by guards and impounded. The three siblings struggle together through the snow, separated now from their father. Their existence is more desperate than ever. They become involved with mule-trains that smuggle truck tires over the mountains to Iraq. The high mountain passes are so cold that the mules are given water laced with alcohol, to keep them going--thus the title. Ameneh agrees to marry into a Kurdish family from across the mountains, if they will pay for Madi's operation. What happens then I will not reveal.</p><p>The movie is brief, spare and heartbreaking. It won the Camera d'Or, for best first film, at Cannes this year. Some find it boring, but I suspect they are lacking in empathy (one Internet critic magnanimously concedes that the movie "might have contained some appeal" if "my life were pathetic enough"). "A Time for Drunken Horses" has the same kind of conviction as movies like "<a href=#>The Bicycle Thief</a>," "Salaam Bombay" and "<a href=#>Pixote</a>"--movies that look unblinkingly at desperate lives on the margin.</p><p>The larger message is perhaps in code. The Iranian cinema, agreed to be one of the most creative in the world today, often makes films about children so that politics seem beside the point, even if they are not. First-time filmmaker <a href=#>Bahman Ghobadi</a>, who wrote and directed this film, may or may not have intended to do anything but tell his simple story, but the buried message argues for the rights of ethnic minorities in Iran and everywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46aZK2hnZp6p7vRZpurrZ6gsq95x6iprJ2jYn9xfI8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-best-finding-nemo-characters-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 best Finding Nemo characters, ranked</span></a>
