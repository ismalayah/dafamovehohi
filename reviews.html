<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Q and A movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1990)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>What does that kind of talk signify? Is it said in affection? Sometimes. Sometimes not. Is it said as a territorial thing--I'm Italian and you're not? Is it tribal, reminding everyone of loyalties that can be called on in times of trouble? At some level it's accepted--everyone in this movie uses racial and ethnic slang constantly--and yet, at another level, it is just what it sounds like, a kind of macho name-calling?</p><p>In Lumet's New York City, the streets are seen as dangerously near to spinning out of control. To the Irish-American chief of the homicide bureau (<a href=#>Patrick O'Neal</a>), that means it is time to close ranks. It's a war out there, he believes, between the cops and the people who would destroy the city (by which he instinctively means Blacks and Hispanics). When a legendary Irish street cop named Brennan (<a href=#>Nick Nolte</a>) shoots a Puerto Rican in a slum doorway, O'Neal calls in a young Assistant D.A. (<a href=#>Timothy Hutton</a>) to head the investigation. But he briefs Hutton very specifically: "This is an open-and-shut case."</p><p>It is not. Hutton begins to suspect that Brennan may have committed murder. His investigation leads him into the lives of people in many different ethnic groups--and he is shocked one day when a Hispanic drug dealer (<a href=#>Armand Assante</a>) walks in with a woman (<a href=#>Jenny Lumet</a>) who Hutton once dated, and still loves.</p><p>He meets her privately, and asks her to come back to him. She will not. He assumed she was Hispanic when they dated, and she will never forget the look in his eyes, she says, when he met her father for the first time, and learned that she was black. Is it always there, the movie wonders--that instinctive racial discrimination that seems to be absorbed when we're young, and has to be unlearned as part of the process of growing up and growing better?</p><p>The movie is about such questions, but in a subtle way, while the central story involves a web of treachery, bribery and deceit. This is a movie with a large cast, and one of the ways Lumet deals with that is to use fine, experienced actors who almost exude the traits of their characters. There's <a href=#>Charles Dutton</a>, as a hard-boiled black detective who explains that his real color is blue--"and when I was in the Army, it was olive drab." There's <a href=#>Luis Guzman</a> as his partner, a Puerto Rican detective who knows and accepts the realities of the streets but has his limits. There's <a href=#>Lee Richardson</a> as an old Jewish lawyer who has high standards and gives wise counsel to Hutton--but is also finally part of the system.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46qZJqmlGKu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-deere-820.html><span>←</span><span>John Deere 820 HP, Price, Specs, Reviews &amp;amp; Pictures 2022</span></a>
