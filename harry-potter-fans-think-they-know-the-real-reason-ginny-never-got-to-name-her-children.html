They believe that the reason why Ginny never named her children is that she has no naming skills. An example is when she named Ron’s owl Pigwidgeon because it sounded ‘cute’. What a terrible name for an owl, but for some reason, the creature took a liking to it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true><a href=#>the real reason Ginny wasn’t the one naming most of her children</a> from <a href=#>harrypotter</a></figure><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Some fans agreed with OP’s theory and shared other names that Ginny chose. One example was the name ‘Arnold’ for her pet Pygmy Puff. While that’s fine, it’s quite a boring name. However, fans theorized that it’s probably based on her brother but with the letters swapped around.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-1.54.44-pm.png><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>However, other fans believed that Ginny is good with names and ‘Pigwidgeon’ is a better name compared to what Harry chose. I mean, who names their kids after a guy who bullied them for years? After all, Pigwidgeon is a real word. According to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Merriam-Webster dictionary</a>, it means “an insignificant or simple person”.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-2.03.27-pm.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-1.57.05-pm.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-2.00.41-pm.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-26-at-2.00.56-pm.png><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>It was revealed at the end of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows</a>&nbsp;that Harry and Ginny had three children. Their eldest is named after Harry’s father, James, and godfather, Sirius Black. Their second one is named after two Hogwarts headmasters, Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. And their third and last child is named after his mother, Lily, and friend, Luna Lovegood. Currently, it’s unknown whether or not Ginny played a role in naming their children, but at least she was supportive of the choices made.</p><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>But let’s be real, these two have an interesting way of choosing names for their pets and kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon5qqoq56sbvTrZyrZZaWu7R506Ggp6NdqbWmxYykpaivXam1pnnRnpilZaKarrS7zWaeoqaernqvsdWeqWafn6l6tbuMp5imnV2dsrN5wqGgpZyimrtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./halle-berry-husband-and-children-name-explored-her-wiki-bio-net-worth-and-instagram-207916-html.html><span>←</span><span>Halle Berry Husband And Children Name Explored- Her Wiki Bio Net Worth And Instagram</span></a>
