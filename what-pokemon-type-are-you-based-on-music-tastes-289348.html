In fact, I don't really know why it'd be separated from classical music to begin with. I'm pretty sure more meaningful classical music genre distinctions could have been made. In fact, I think it would have been neat if they had put "Early Music" instead. It would have fit pretty well with folk and world music, I think.</p><p>I honestly have no clue what "singer-songwriter" even means. But, hey, I don't know what half of the genres in the image mean. Lol. Like "Breaks", "No Wave", "Shoegaze", "Slowcore" (do we have to add "core" onto everything nowadays? Bizarre trend), "Darkwave", "Ethereal Wave", "Twee", and pretty much literally ever genre listed under "Glitch".</p><p>Even still, of the genres I know, a lot of them blend together for me... but I'm pretty opinionated. I don't care for anything too electronic, so I just kind of lump it all as "Techno" and move on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy4tMCtZKmnm5q6sLqMrbCpnV2Wv6Z52KisZpqRqLKlec6nZKato56wbsDArKueq15nhXp%2Fk3Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taniya-kaur-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-614202-html.html><span>←</span><span>Taniya Kaur Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
