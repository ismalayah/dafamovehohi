<a href=../../../isnt-it-romantic-2019.html></a>
The film from director Todd Strauss-Schulson (“A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas”) and screenwriters Erin Cardillo and Dana Fox & Katie Silberman places Wilson at the center of a tricky balancing act. “Isn’t It Romantic” simultaneously ridicules and embraces the many, many clichés of the rom-com genre.

In "Freaky Friday," a mother and daughter swap bodies to show the challenges each of them face at that age. "Heaven Can Wait" gives an ex-football star a new lease on life with newfound appreciation.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is Sheinelle Jones Pregnant?

Jackson and his team have a lot of fun creating these three-dimensional worlds, overwhelming us with different moods, energies, and personalities. Some of the images are breathtaking: the Long Lake swathed in mist with mysterious structures rising out of it; the misty dark wood filled with shadowy waiting creatures; the elegant vertical fortress of the elves, soothing and yet rigid, too, indicating the elves' unwillingness to get involved in the larger dark forces overtaking the outside world.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/13/>← Prev Page</a>
