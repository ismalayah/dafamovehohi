<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Importance Of Being Earnest movie review (2002)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Oliver Parker's film begins with music that is a little too modern for the period, circa 1895, following the current fashion in anachronistic movie scores. It waltzes us into the story of two men who are neither one named Ernest and who both at various times claim to be. Jack Worthing (<a href=#>Colin Firth</a>) calls himself Jack in the country and Ernest in town. In the country, he is the guardian of the charming Miss Cecily Cardew (<a href=#>Reese Witherspoon</a>), who is the granddaughter of the elderly millionaire who adopted Jack after finding him as an infant in a handbag he was handed in error at the cloakroom in Victoria Station. When Jack grows bored with the country, he cites an imaginary younger brother named Ernest who lives in London and must be rescued from scrapes with the law.</p><p>This imaginary person makes perfect sense to Jack's friend Algernon Moncrieff (<a href=#>Rupert Everett</a>), who lives in town but has a fictitious friend named Bunbury who lives in the country and whose ill health provides Algernon an excuse to get out of town. I have gone into such detail about these names and alternate identities because the entire play is constructed out of such silliness, and to explain all of it would require--well, the play.</p><p>In town Jack is much besotted by Gwendolen Fairfax (<a href=#>Frances O'Connor</a>), daughter of the formidable Lady Bracknell (<a href=#>Judi Dench</a>), Algernon's aunt, who is willing to consider Jack as a suitor for the girl but nonplussed to learn that he has no people--none at all--and was indeed left in a bag at the station. Thus her remark about his carelessness in losing both parents.</p><p>Algernon in the meantime insinuates himself into the country estate where young Cecily is being educated under the watchful eye of Miss Prism (<a href=#>Anna Massey</a>), the governess; eventually all of the characters gather at the Manor House, Woolton, where there's some confusion since Algernon has taken the name Ernest for his visit and proposed to Cecily, so that when Cecily meets Gwendolen, they both believe they are engaged to Ernest although Cecily of course doesn't know that in town Gwendolen knows Jack as Ernest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmaK9sL7TmqWcnV2ks26uxKKloGWVlr%2BvsdKtZGtoYGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gamestop-thanksgiving.html><span>←</span><span>GameStop will be open on Thanksgiving this year</span></a>
