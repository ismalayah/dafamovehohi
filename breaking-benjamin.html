Breaking Benjamin Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴Crowded streets are cleared away
One by one
Hollow heroes seperate
As they runYou're so cold
Keep your hand in mine
Wise men wonder while Strong men dieShow me how it ends
It's alright
Show me how defenseless
You really are
Satisfied and empty inside.
That's alright
Let's give this another try

The opening lyrics paint a picture of a desolate place where the streets are empty and the heroes have fled. Despite the multitude of people around, the singer feels completely alone. The refrain "You're so cold" indicates that the person who left was emotionally distant and unfeeling. The singer is trying to reach out to this person, wanting to hold their hand and fix what is broken between them. The line "wise men wonder while strong men die" speaks to the idea that even those who are seemingly strong can still suffer emotionally and that it takes more courage to confront your feelings and face them head-on.</p><br><p>Throughout the song, the singer is asking the other person to reveal their true self, to stop hiding behind a facade of strength and to show their vulnerabilities. They want to understand what caused the other person to leave and the extent of their emotional emptiness. Despite the pain they feel, the singer is willing to give the relationship another try, hoping that they can bring closure to their past and move forward together.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Crowded streets are cleared away</u><br>People have left the streets and gone home.</p><br><p><u>One by one</u><br>They left individually, not in groups.</p><br><p><u>Hollow heroes separate</u><br>Fake heroes leave and reveal their true selves.</p><br><p><u>As they run</u><br>They are afraid and trying to escape.</p><br><p><u>You're so cold</u><br>You have a cold and heartless personality.</p><br><p><u>Keep your hand in mine</u><br>Hold onto me and don't let go.</p><br><p><u>Wise men wonder while</u><br>Smart people question things while they watch.</p><br><p><u>Strong men die</u><br>Powerful people may still fail.</p><br><p><u>Show me how it ends</u><br>Let me see how this will finish.</p><br><p><u>It's alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>Show me how defenseless</u><br>Reveal your true vulnerability to me.</p><br><p><u>You really are</u><br>You are truly helpless.</p><br><p><u>Satisfied and empty inside.</u><br>You may appear content but have nothing meaningful.</p><br><p><u>That's alright</u><br>It's okay, don't worry.</p><br><p><u>Let's give this another try</u><br>We should attempt this again.</p><br><p><u>If you find your family</u><br>If you discover your loved ones.</p><br><p><u>Don't you cry</u><br>Don't be upset about it.</p><br><p><u>In this land of make believe...</u><br>In this fictional world we live in.</p><br><p><u>Dead and dry</u><br>Devoid of life and emotion.</p><br><p><u>But you feel alive</u><br>You may have a cold exterior, but you still feel emotions.</p><br><p><u>Lay your head on me</u><br>Rest, take comfort in me.</p><br><p><u>One last time...</u><br>For the final occasion.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><u>It's Alright</u><br>Everything is going to be okay.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Alaina E.
