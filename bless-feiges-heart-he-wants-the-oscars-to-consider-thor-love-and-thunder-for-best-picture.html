While it did list films that could be considered to be strong contenders, such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Turning Red</a>,&nbsp;the markedly-less-strong <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor: Love and Thunder</a>&nbsp;was added to the list, in hopes the Academy would consider the film to be nominated for ‘Best Picture.’</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>It is absolutely no secret the fourth&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;film&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performed poorly compared to&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World</a>. Not to mention, the film didn’t exactly kick off to a flying start,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only earning $46 million during the first weekend.</a> So the fact that Feige and everyone at Marvel Studios and Disney have high hopes for this film to be considered for ‘Best Picture’ is hilarious.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=835 data-injectable=true>It’s also rare for a superhero film to even be nominated for ‘Best Picture’, based on recent patterns from previous nominations. The most recent was DC’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joker</a>, but that was more of a gritty origin story rather than your typical superhero flick. And if a Superhero does win a major category, it’s more likely to be in the ‘Best Animated Feature,’ just like when <a href=#>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse</a> won in 2018</p><p data-characters=120 data-current-count=120 data-injectable=false>Naturally, those online are roasting Disney for “aiming high” for what has to be the worst MCU film of 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Disney is willing to shoot their shot with no chance, you can too. <a href=#>https://t.co/bdOTnDLdO4</a></p>— john finnegan (@FinneyFlame) <a href=#>December 12, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the confidence is admirable ill give them that <a href=#>https://t.co/C0Fwz8pief</a></p>— eve (@tifariku) <a href=#>December 11, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nah this def what they mean when they say shoot your shot even tho she WAY outta your league. <a href=#>https://t.co/A0Exp9JU6V</a></p>— Neo of War: Ragnarok (@NeoGameSpark) <a href=#>December 11, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>It is comedic to see Disney aim high with one of its poorly performing films, but it is important to note that Disney has the Oscars in a chokehold, most notably&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the animation category</a>.
