Although, he and Hamill were rarely seen working on the same shows or movies. Aside from The Empire Strikes Back, the only other project in which they may have crossed paths professionally might have been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: The Animated </a><a href=#>Series</a>. Williams voiced professor Achilles Milo for two episodes, and Hamill, as we all know, is the voice of the Joker. However, their characters weren‚Äôt even in the same episode, so who knows?</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=false>It seems more likely that the two were just good friends outside of work. Hamill‚Äôs tribute is not the only one, as other Hollywood icons have taken the time to write kind words, including Malcolm McDowell, James Woods, and Billy Baldwin ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">among others.</a> Fans also expressed their shock at the actor‚Äôs passing underneath Hamill‚Äôs heartfelt tweet. While Treat Williams may be gone, his legacy among his friends in Hollywood clearly lives on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S6or7KZp%2BapZmhuW68wLKqZqyinq%2B2wMRmq6hlmJ7AbrLRopynnF2pv6at02auoqScnq6uv4yipWaglZa%2Fta7RnpikoZ6cerXDxJ6raA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamie-siminoff-net-worth.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Jamie Siminoff Net Worth: A Look at the Entrepreneurs Impressive Career and Wealth</span></a>
