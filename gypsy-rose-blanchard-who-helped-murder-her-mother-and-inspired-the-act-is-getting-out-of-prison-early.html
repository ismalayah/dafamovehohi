Blanchard is about seven years in to a 10-year-sentence.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>The story behind the killing was so bizarre that it spawned not only a HBO documentary called Mommy Dead and Dearest but also a scripted show called The Act starring Joey King as Gypsy and Patricia Arquette as the mother Dee Dee.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Why the murder? Since Gypsy was a baby, Dee Dee continuously claimed that her daughter had a number of ailments. Those ailments included sleep apnea, seizures, visual problems, hearing issues and more. Gypsy was subjected to numerous surgeries that included removing her salivary glands and an operation on her eyes.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Her teeth rotted and they were removed. Gypsy was presented as a sickly, bald child who couldn’t walk, needed a feeding tube, and had cancer. The truth was that Gypsy was only bald because her mother shaved her head.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>She didn’t need a feeding tube or a wheelchair. Her mother may have been suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a disorder where someone fakes ill health for attention – in this case it was her daughter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>When they saw a doctor that disagreed with Dee Dee or showed contradictory results, Dee Dee would find a new doctor.

Gypsy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ran away</a> in 2011 after she met a man online, but her mother tracked her down and convinced the man she was a minor, even though her real age was 19.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>She eventually met Godejohn on a Christian dating site. She asked him to kill her mother and he came to her house in June 2015 and stabbed Dee Dee to death. Gypsy waited in her room with her ears covered.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>In an interview on the Dr. Phil show, Gypsy revealed that she prefers prison to living with her mother. She’ll soon get to experience an all new type of freedom altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8ayp6yxXae8tLGMm6OappOdrrOwjLCfqGWYmrmxscNmpK6qlJq%2FbrTEq2Smp6SdsrN5wKebZqGeqL2qvsSdZK2glWKupMCMoqpmn5Wpwaq6xmamrqxdpLNuvNGiqqimXZqus7jYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-muppet-movie-1979.html><span>←</span><span>The Muppet Movie movie review (1979)</span></a>
