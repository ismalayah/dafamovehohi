This is where the WWF Merchandise catalog would be. The direct center would be a two-page layout of various WWF Superstars sporting their new shirts they were selling. Everyone from Tito Santana to Jake Roberts to Outback Jack would be posing with their shirts on. Back then, it was a “big deal” to have a shirt. Every shirt would sellout at the merchandise stands, even that medium gray “The Rebel” Dick Slater one!</p><p>The fun part of those catalogs were seeing all the different items they would have for sale. Who can forget the guy standing there with his WWF satin shorts on or the WWF baseball cap? I always wondered who that guy was, by the way! How about the Million Dollar Man piggy bank or George Steele’s “Mine” doll? The flip of a page and you could find WWF postcards or a Strike Force poster.</p><p>Who can forget a young Stephanie McMahon posing with British Bulldogs and Rockers shirts on? How about that Hulk Hogan foam finger you had when you were eight? Who out there remembers Jimmy Hart’s megaphone for sale? You&nbsp;could purchase bedroom sets, puzzles, mugs, bandanas, sunglasses, beach towels, LJN figures, and everything else under the sun.</p><p>What I would do to have all that stuff again!</p><p>I had Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Randy Savage, JYD, George Steele, and Ricky Steamboat Stretch Wrestlers still new in the box. I sold them a couple of years ago for $100 each. Yes, I want to slap myself in the back of my head and call myself an idiot one hundred times. I wish I had these back!</p><p>I wanted to do something cool at my 80’s Wrestling Con on April 27th in Freehold, NJ at iPlay America and decided to do an “Ultimate 80’s Wrestling Auction” as one of the main features at the Con. It will be Chinese Auction/Tricky Tray style. A bucket will be in front of each item. You purchase tickets and put the tickets into the basket of which items you want. If we pick your ticket, you win that item. There’s no limit of how many tickets you can put in each bucket. Pretty cool, huh?</p><p>We have tons of rare 80’s Wrestling items that will be available for the Ultimate 80’s Wrestling Auction, including Von Erich board game still sealed, 1985 Hulk Hogan cap, WWF hooded jacket, 1985 WWF vending machine stickers, WrestleMania 1-3 Coliseum Videos, Bret Hart sunglasses still sealed, Hulk Hogan cake pan, WWF View Master, WWF children’s birthday set, WWF VCR WrestleMania game sealed, Hulk Hogan laundry bag, and so much more. There will be over 50 items available!
