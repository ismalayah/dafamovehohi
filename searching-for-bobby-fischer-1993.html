<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Searching for Bobby Fischer movie review (1993)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This is both a blessing and a curse. There is a beauty to the gift, but it does not necessarily lead to greater happiness in life as a whole.</p><p>The wonderful new film "Searching for Bobby Fischer" contains in its title a reminder of that truth. Bobby Fischer was arguably the greatest chess player of all time. As a boy, he faced and defeated the greatest players of his time. In 1972, after a prelude of countless controversies, he won the world chess championship away from the Russians for the first time in years. Then he essentially disappeared into a netherworld of rented rooms, phantom sightings, paranoid outbursts and allegiance to a religious cult. He reappeared not long ago to win a lucrative chess match in Yugoslavia, for which he was willing to lose his citizenship. His games are models of elegance and artistry. His life does not inspire envy.</p><p>"Searching for Bobby Fischer," a film of remarkable sensitivity and insight, tells a story based on fact, about a "new" Bobby Fischer - a young boy named Josh Waitzkin (<a href=#>Max Pomeranc</a>) who was born with a gift for chess, which he nurtured in the rough-and-tumble world of of chess hustlers in New York's Washington Square Park. His parents are at first doubtful of his talent, then proud of it, then concerned about how he can develop it without stunting the other areas of his life.</p><p>The film is the first intelligent one I can remember seeing about chess. That is the case even though no knowledge of chess is necessary to understand it, and some of the filmmaking strategies - such as showing most of the moves at lightning speed - simply ignore the periods of inaction in games. It is intelligent because it is about the meaning of chess, a game that has been compared to war and plundered for its lurking Freudian undertones, and yet is essentially just an arrangement of logical outcomes.</p><p>In the film, Josh learns the moves by watching them played in the park. At first his parents, Fred and Bonnie Waitzkin (<a href=#>Joe Mantegna</a> and <a href=#>Joan Allen</a>), are even unaware he can play, and there is a sweet scene in which the boy allows his father to win a game, to spare his feelings. Josh's first teacher is a black chess hustler named Vinnie (<a href=#>Laurence Fishburne</a>), who uses an in-your- face approach and advises unorthodox moves to throw an opponent off.</p><p>Eventually Fred becomes convinced his son needs more advanced tutelage, and hires the brilliant but prickly Bruce Pandolfini (<a href=#>Ben Kingsley</a>), a difficult case - but then all good chess players are difficult cases.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46snJqqk522r7OMn6arZZKkr6PFjJ%2BgrJuYmr9ufZhyag%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2019.html><span>←</span><span>Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood movie review (2019)</span></a>
