<a href=../../../../a-good-person-movie-review-2023.html></a>
Three badly hurt people help each other in "A Good Person." Writer/director Zach Braff anchors the film with tender-hearted, touching performances by Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh. Both play characters who struggle to find a way forward after devastating failures with tragic consequences.&nbsp;
It is more formally conventional than his first film, "Garden State," and thankfully less self-indulgent than his second film, "Wish I Was Here." "A Good Person" benefits from the same shrewd sense of detail and character evident in both, taking on ambitious themes of addiction, abuse, abandonment, overwhelming grief, and finding a way to forgive the unforgivable, even when it means forgiving yourself.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Safe Haven Review</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../safe-haven-movie-review.html></a>
Recommended Videos Safe Haven is the umpteenth adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel and the second that has been directed by Lasse Hallström (who previously made Dear John). This one is a little different from the other Sparks stories though in that it is a mystery as well as a romance. But those going into Safe Haven expecting The Notebook redux will come out of it terribly disappointed as it quickly degenerates into a Sleeping With The Enemy rip-off and is undone by a convoluted story, contrived characters and a lot of shameless manipulation on the part of the filmmakers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Where Are All Of Mr. Ts Children See How His 2 Daughters And A Son Have Grown Up Now</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

Stevens makes you want to explore Don’s Freudian abode by playing up the sound of glass marbles lazily rolling across wood floors; a silhouette’s ambiguous shape behind a frosted window pane; and the steady, soft clanking of a dumb waiter’s metal chain as it rises up a narrow, asbestos-filled passage. There’s a dark spot on the wall that crumbles when you touch it, and you really can’t go far without spotting the milk-white fluid that spills out of and over odd places (yes, that is a used condom).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>John Q. movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2002)</h2><time>Jul 14, 2024</time>

There are two options: a heart transplant, or optimizing Mike's "quality of life" during the "months ... weeks ... days" left to him. Joining the doctor is appropriately named hospital administrator Rebecca Payne (Anne Heche), who already knows the Archibalds have no money, and argues for the "quality of life" choice.
John Q. thinks he's covered by insurance, but no: His company switched to a new HMO that has a $20,000 ceiling, and since John has been downsized to 20 hours a week, he's lucky to have that much coverage.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/20/>← Prev Page</a>
