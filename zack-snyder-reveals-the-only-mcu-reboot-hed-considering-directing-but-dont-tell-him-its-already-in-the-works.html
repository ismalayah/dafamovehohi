The Snyderverse architect explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THR</a>, to promote his new sci-fi epic for Netflix, Rebel Moon, that he’s not interested in doing any more superhero films for the time being. Unless a certain opportunity came his way courtesy of Kevin Feige. Specifically, Snyder would be very tempted to join his former competition if they asked him to make a Daredevil and Elektra movie, preferably based on Frank Miller’s Elektra Lives Again comic. “But that’s it,” he said, drawing a line in the sand.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Snyder’s dream project might be a Daredevil and Elektra movie, but unfortunately for him this reboot is already happening… twice over, in fact. Charlie Cox’s Man Without Fear is, of course, a regular player in the MCU these days, and will soon star in Daredevil: Born Again, a Disney Plus relaunch of the beloved Netflix series that shares its name with another iconic Frank Miller comic. Meanwhile, the original cinematic Elektra, Jennifer Garner, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reprising her role in next July’s Deadpool 3</a>.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=396 data-injectable=false>In other words, don’t expect Snyder to pull a James Gunn and switch sides by buddying up with Kevin Feige to bring Daredevil back to the screen. Maybe he had a slight window of opportunity there, when Born Again went back to the drawing board amid some creative differences, but that’s now passed.
