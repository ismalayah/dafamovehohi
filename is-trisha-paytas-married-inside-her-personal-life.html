Inside Her Personal Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Trisha Paytas</strong> and Anthony Michael Hall were formerly in a relationship.&nbsp;In fact, their affair is often regarded as Paytas’ first high-profile relationship. They spanned the years 2008 through 2013.&nbsp;While neither of them has said why they separated up, it is widely assumed that their separation was not amicable. A tweet from Paytas in October 2017 lends credence to the notion.&nbsp;Paytas slammed The Breakfast Club singer in the post, alleging that he gave them STDs.</p><h2>Trisha Paytas Moved on from Anthony Michael Hall</h2><p>Paytas began dating Roger Bart the same year she divorced Hall. Their romance lasted around two and a half years until they split up in 2015.&nbsp;Years after their split, the internet celebrity addressed their time together with Bart in an October 2017 tweet.&nbsp;Unlike Hall, Paytas wrote positive things about Bart, adding that they missed spending time with him.</p><h2>Other Relationships of Trisha Paytas</h2><p>Paytas moved on with WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler in 2016 after their breakup with Bart.&nbsp;They remained together for a year, and in June 2017, they posted a video on YouTube about him.&nbsp;There, the singer addressed Ziggler, revealing that he had dumped them on a date. They also made remarks about wrestling, calling it bogus and claiming Ziggler was a “37-year-old guy” who was going to retire from the sport.&nbsp;According to Ring Side News, Ziggler did not show up to a basketball game on the scheduled day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Trisha-Paytas-1.jpg><p>Paytas began dating YouTuber Jason Nash in 2017, and the pair stayed together till 2019. Paytas announced to their YouTube viewers that they and Nash had called it quits. Furthermore, Paytas said in the hour-long video that the two hadn’t been together in a long time. “This is a film that could have been recorded two months ago since we have been split up for two months,” they said, adding that their last conversation was on their birthday night.</p><p>Paytas created a romance rumor with Aaron Carter the same year. Carter was also accused of sleeping with them and cheating on his fiancée at the time. This was also the final love relationship Paytas had before meeting their spouse, Moses Hacmon.</p><h2>Trisha Paytas&nbsp;Husband</h2><p>Paytas married Hacmon in 2021 after a year of courtship.&nbsp;The couple married on December 11, 2021, after footage from the event circulated on Instagram.&nbsp;The next day, Paytas uploaded two films to their YouTube channel: a wedding vlog and a post-wedding mukbang video.&nbsp;Trisha Paytas, who dated Anthony Michael Hall in the past, and Moses Hacmon are getting married for the second time.</p><p>Paytas and Hacmon were not through with their marriage. On January 1, 2022, they posted a video on YouTube titled ‘WE GOT MARRIED (AGAIN) IN HAWAII!’ Paytas stated in the video’s description, “We had such a wonderful wedding that we repeated it twice, and we want to continue celebrating our love for the next year! Israel is the next stop. Where else should we tie the knot?” The YouTuber shared their joy when Paytas said that they would marry Hacmon in Israel next. Paytas said that married life was the finest life and awarded it a 10/10 rating.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrGWkp7a0tMBmp5qxpJbAbrnAq6minZRitq%2B%2FyJ2cZqCVp3qxsdGspqeZnGK5qrLEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./153872-chris-morgane-stapleton-reveal-gender-th-html.html><span>←</span><span>Chris &amp;amp; Morgane Stapleton Reveal Gender of Their Newborn &amp;amp; Show Baby's Face (Photo)</span></a>
