He has, over the course of his 68-year career, delivered such classics as The Producers, Blazing Saddles&nbsp;and High Anxiety. But it’s another two, very different films of his that have combined to bring us some welcome news today, as the filmmaker discussed <strong>Spaceballs 2</strong> at a screening of Young Frankenstein.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>The screening took place at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center on Sunday, May 21st, and Brooks was on hand for a Q & A session afterward. During this event, he was asked about the likelihood of a sequel to 1987’s Spaceballs, and Brooks confirmed that discussions are underway.</p><p>“Well, you know, I’m doing it. MGM is slightly interested in doing it because of the new Star Wars… They think maybe, so we’re talking.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So… will there be a Spaceballs 2?! <a href=#>#MelBrooks</a> says… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ei89hTJLD7</a></p><p>— New Jersey Performing Arts Center (@NJPAC) <a href=#>May 21, 2017</a></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Spaceballs is a parody of adventure science-fictions films and it stars Bill Pullman, Daphne Zuniga, Rick Moranis, John Candy, and Mel Brooks, among others, and sees Lord Dark Helmet (Moranis) seek to steal the air supply of another planet, at the orders of President Skroob (Brooks) of the planet Spaceballs. It’s then up to Lone Starr (Pullman) and Princess Vespa (Zuniga) to stop them.</p><p data-characters=706 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>At the Young Frankenstein event, Brooks noted that the resurgence in the popularity of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> – thanks to The Force Awakens&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rogue One</a> – has certainly made it easier to convince MGM to pursue Spaceballs 2, but it remains to be seen whether pressure from fans will be sufficient to push the project to fruition. Spaceballs has increased in popularity since its initial 1987 release, and it would certainly be fascinating to see the comedy master’s satirical take on the modern-day variations in the adventure science-fiction genre. A number of the original cast have passed away in the years since the first film’s release, however, so there are some significant narrative issues to overcome.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=false>It’s heartening to know that Mel Brooks – now in his 90th year – still has some stories to tell, though, and if <strong>Spaceballs 2</strong> does grace our screens someday soon, we also know that hilarity will be guaranteed. In these modern times, comedy has never been more necessary – and there are few filmmakers better placed to deliver it than one of that genre’s most venerated and beloved figures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJopJ6kXZe%2FsLvKrGSdnZaeu6rAxKWwZpyZqLC2v9KipqerXai9oq%2FEm5ilpKNif3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-fix-tiktoks-ai-manga-filter-if-its-not-working.html><span>←</span><span>How to fix TikToks AI manga filter if its not working</span></a>
