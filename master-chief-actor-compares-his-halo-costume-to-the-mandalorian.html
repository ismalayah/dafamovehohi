In Halo, the Spartans take their helmet off a ton — it’s only Master Chief’s face you haven’t seen before,” he said.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Talking about the Spartan armor, in particular, Schreiber said:</p><p>“It’s 50 pounds of plastic and the suit is meant to make you superhuman — it enhances the Spartan’s capability for his performance tenfold. In reality, it’s the opposite. It’s a challenge to manipulate a cumbersome costume and find ways to shoot it so it looks like you’re super capable.”</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>After many years of being stuck in development hell, Master Chief is finally making his live-action debut in the upcoming Halo<strong> </strong>series on Paramount Plus, a debut that’ll no doubt elevate one of the best-selling entertainment franchises of all time to even greater heights of popularity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/FMuaVS7XMAI5MR4.jpg><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Adapted from a video game series that has gone on more than 20 years without a live-action adaptation, the series will understandably receive its fair share of backlash when it premieres. But I think it’s fair to say that the majority of the fandom is excited to see how Halo will put a different spin on the established universe of the sci-fi military story.</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=false>Halo is set to premiere on Paramount Plus on March 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdKtnKtlk522prKMmpqtp6JisLC5z5qpnqtdnba0eceao6hlk6TAtcHMnmStp12ptaZ5zJqlnZmcpL%2Bqrc1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apollo-bowie-flynn-rossdale.html><span>←</span><span>Gwen Stefani's Son Apollo Bowie Flynn Rossdale.
