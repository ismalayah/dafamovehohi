And now, the latest poster for Child’s Play&nbsp;has decided to have some fun with the competition between the two films, deciding who would come out on top between Chucky and Woody in a fight.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Sure, the Pixar film is likely going to win the box office battle, but the poor cowboy toy wouldn’t make it to Toy Story 5&nbsp;if he encountered the pint-sized killer in person. Don’t believe us? Just check out the disturbing poster below, which sees Chucky’s foot walking away from a familiar-looking stuffed arm (note that Woody’s sleeve is red instead of yellow here though, as Orion don’t want any unwanted calls from Disney’s legal team).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/childs-play-poster.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Star Gabriel Bateman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the new poster on Instagram</a> and had some fun with the similarity between his character in the movie, Andy Barclay, and the iconic kid from the&nbsp;TS&nbsp;franchise with the same name. “So long, partner. I got a new best buddy and this time he’s not just a toy…,” Bateman wrote in his caption. “He’s my best friend! LOVE, ANDY.”</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>The new&nbsp;Child’s Play&nbsp;will give the character a techno-horror bent, swapping the original origin story of a murderer’s soul possessing an ordinary doll for a state-of-the-art “Smart Doll” that goes haywire and starts killing folks. Mark Hamill voices the doll while Aubrey Plaza stars as Karen, Andy’s mom who buys him the dangerously defective toy, and Brian Tyree Henry plays Detective Mike Norris.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Watch out for Chucky slashing his way back onto cinema screens this summer in <strong>Child’s Play</strong>.&nbsp;And make sure not to take your kids to the wrong movie about toys on June 21st.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGhnJnAbrzLmrBmqJ%2Bowaa%2BjJ%2Bcmqylp7K0ecOaqaRlpKTGbr%2FTqKmyZWRisLO70qymr52iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-lisa-yaro-parents-ethnicity-explored-is-she-dating-anyone-242791-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Lisa Yaro Parents?
