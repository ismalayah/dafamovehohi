Commenters agree, however, that they wouldn’t be quite as patient. Some even said that they would never enter their home without a poncho. Others praised Jlo’s impeccable aim, which allowed him to do several impressive trick shots that lead to the balloon falling on his wife’s head.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>A more pressing question in the comment section is what the cleanup for such a messy prank is like.
