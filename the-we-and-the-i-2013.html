<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The We and the I movie review (2013)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The film introduces a dozen or so characters and shifts the narrative between them in an effortless, natural way that gives us a good idea of the group dynamics, as well as some individual backstories. Even though the whole of "The We and the I" is set inside the bus, Gondry peppers the film with innovative flashbacks, shot on low-def video and serving as visual footnotes: some real, some imaginary. The whole movie feels like a breeze and has the lively rhythm of the kids' talk, which sounds totally authentic and was actually improvised in a workshop Gondry ran with his actors prior to the shooting.</p><p>The material truly feels like it arose from the kids themselves: they're playing characters who seem close to who they really are, which is not to say they're not acting. Gondry has done a great job with easing them into a relaxed mode that — combined with fantastic camerawork by Alex Disenhof and sharp editing by Gondry's regular collaborator Jeff Buchanan — gives the film a spontaneous vibe. "</p><p>The We and the I" is filled with little details that ring true: the way the kids relate to one another, roll their eyes at each other, play stupid jokes, make guest lists for sweet sixteen parties, etc. In terms of sheer authenticity, this may be the single most real film about how contemporary American teenagers of assorted ethnicities behave — which is all the more remarkable if one keeps in mind that Gondry is a Frenchman.</p><p>As the day comes to a close and the bus is nearing its final stop, the group gets smaller and the movie becomes more focused, finally zeroing in on the rambunctious Michael (<a href=#>Michael Brodie</a>) and the quiet, artistically inclined Teresa (<a href=#>Teresa Lynn</a>). Throughout the film, we've seen the multiple ways in which these two have circled around each other, with the boy acting stupidly most of the time and the girl retreating into her drawing.</p><p>During the final minutes, after the sun has set and the bus moves through the night, Michael and Teresa learn a tragic punch line to a funny video clip everyone was watching before. We are left to suspect that these two have connected on some level and it's too bad Gondry doesn't develop the subject any further (all we get is their muted conversation as the credits roll, with both actors seemingly out of character).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lp5p6orrDZquhnV2eenN8kGw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./molly-shannon.html><span>←</span><span>Molly Shannon Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
